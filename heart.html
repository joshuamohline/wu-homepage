				<p>In Luke, we are taught that "From the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks." This set of lessons is intended to minister to your heart. Teachings talk about identity and understanding that you are a son or daughter of the King. 
                <br><br>Some classes talk about growing in intimacy with the Lord. Steffany Gretzinger has a lesson on "Embracing the Process" where she shares her journey of getting to know our Father closer and closer throughout her life. We aim to impart this same passion and heart for growing closer to Him in your own life. 
                <br><br>Other classes speak into the importance of purity and how a pure heart will overflow into all areas of our life, including worship leading and playing. Jump into these classes right away and start growing in your walk with God. </p>
