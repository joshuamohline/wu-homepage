				<p>In every service, our leaders encourage the congregation to bless the people around them before starting worship. This is because we have a firm belief that pleasing worship to the Lord happens in the context of people loving each other well. 
                <br><br>The Community theme emphasises the importance of having healthy interpersonal relationships within our church, family and frienships. Working with senior leadership and dealing with personalities on worship teams is something that can be done well and with honor. 
                <br><br>Lessons cover topics such as brave communication, building a strong community, dealing with difficult people, and creating a culture of worship. As you apply these lessons, watch your community grow stronger and closer to each other, and ultimately the Lord. </p>
