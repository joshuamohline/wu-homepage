				<p>Like learning any instrument or musical skill, songwriting is an artform that must be developed and crafted. Too many times, novice writers try to write a hit song first time out. When it doesn’t happen, they give up and assume they are terrible. Sadly, the world is missing out on great songs that never get written because writers are not giving themselves a chance to develop. 
                <br><br>Brian Johnson, Jenn Johnson, Martin Smith, Paul Baloche, Jeremy Riddle, Dan McCollam, Christa Black, Steffany Gretzinger, William Matthews and Ray Hughes hope to encourage songwriters to develop their music and find their voice. Representing years of writing songs performed by Bethel Music, Jesus Culture, Passion, Vineyard Music and more, these artists each understand how to be a songwriter of excellence. 
                <br><br>Lessons speak into developing your song. Whether you are writing Christian music or not, his tips and tools provide a solid foundation for crafting any song idea into something to be proud of. This includes topics such as finding the right chords to songs, developing interesting lyrics for your songs, and even singing in such a way that you hear the true quality of the song. 
                <br><br>Meanwhile, other classes discuss the heart of songwriting. These messages will help any creative writing endeavor find meaning and direction.  Hear our instructors’ experiences of what has worked and what has not to write endearing, passionate music. 
                <br><br>Likewise, lessons fully articulate the craft of songwriting. They answer those questions like “How can I write a song?” and “What is a songwriter?” with very practical insight for you to easily apply. 
                <br><br>Furthermore, these straight-forward teaching, encourage you to join with your friends, teammates, and community to collaborate on song endeavors. Our instructors share personal stories of how they have watched their own songs go from mediocre to excellent by partnering with each other. As well, they discuss the inception of song ideas and share their song stories. 
                <br><br>This course on “Songwriting” from WorshipU is released in segments at the beginning of each week. You will be able to watch each lesson whenever you want, as many times as you want upon release. Learn to hone your craft and develop your skill. </p>
