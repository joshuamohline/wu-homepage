				<p>Our public ministry is defined by our private ministry. Living a life that is offered to the Lord as a living sacrifice is the ultimate goal of any worshipper. This intentionality of worshipping God in everyday life will greatly impact worship on the stage. 
                <br><br>These lessons cover many personal journeys and testimonies from instructors such as Paul Baloche, Jenn Johnson and Kristene DiMarco of how they learned to live a lifestyle of worship. They invite you to pursue the secret place with the Lord and get to know him on an individual level. 
                <br><br>The lifestyle theme aims to impart a passion for having real, unreserved conversations with the Lord and knowing Him as friend. As you invite Him into every area of your life, this will help you go to new places in musical worship. </p>
