				<p>Every member of a worship team is a leader in some capacity. They are the people who set the tone for what worship looks and sounds like within a given church. We want to empower entire teams to understand their roles as leaders within the church. 
                <br><br>Leadership goes beyond the stage too. Lessons cover topics such as leading a congregation, building a team, spontaneous worship and more. The focus is on imparting an identity to individuals so that you can step into your leadership calling, regardless of instrument or position. 
                <br><br>Classes are taught by experienced leaders in worship and pastoring such as Martin Smith, Brian Johnson, Matt Stinton, William Matthews, and others. Join them as they invite you to learn everything they know on the topic. </p>
