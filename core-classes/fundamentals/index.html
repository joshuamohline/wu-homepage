				<p>The scriptures are packed with verses about how to worship, why to worship and the affects of worship. The Fundamentals theme explores the Biblical foundations for worship. 

                <br><br>Instructors like Dano McCollum, Ray Hughes, Christa Black and others share the keys to going deeper in worship, according to the precedents set in the Psalms, the Gospels and both Old and New Testament scriptures. Learn what it means when Jesus talks about worshipping in spirit and truth and discover the heart of King David as a worshipper. 

                <br><br>These classes aim to give you a thorough Biblical understanding of worship so that you can enter into any environment and have wisdom on inviting the Presence of God and breaking through spiritual walls.  </p>
