          Our passion is your encounter with God
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are passionate about pouring into the up-and-coming worship leaders and artists of our generation and building bridges within the church. More than ever, we are watching God connect us with worship leaders and artists from around the world and across a variety of church streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          At WorshipU On-Campus we love sharing our journey and facilitating times of equipping and encounter- knowing that your personal experiences and growth will ultimately have great impact on the church as a whole. We desire to empower gifted worship leaders, songwriters, musicians, singers, dancers, and artists who feel called to change the world for God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this resonates with your heart, we invite you to join us for WorshipU On-Campus this year. Our hopes are high about what God wants to cultivate and expand in you as we pursue His kingdom together.
        </p>
        <p>
          At WorshipU you’ll experience extended worship times, band sessions, instrument-specific classes, creative expressions, and a variety of guest speakers from Bethel Music, Bethel Church, and around the world. Our priority is that our students would learn at a deeper level how to partner their gifts with the leading of the Holy Spirit. We believe learning to host God’s presence and becoming integrous, skilled leaders is of utmost importance both on and off the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come encounter more of His goodness, improve your worship skills, develop new relationships, and be activated in greater creativity. We believe it will be a life-changing experience. Our dream is to fuel your worship journey with passion, health, and practical knowledge that you can take back to your communities. God is doing incredible things in the earth, and He wants to trust us with more. We’re anticipating a year unlike any other. Join us!
