        <p>
          Breakout sessions offer you a chance to get hands on training on your instrument or skill of choice. Bethel Music musicians teach from experience on guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, and more. We also offer a large selection of skill development classes for photographers, sound engineers, painters, dancers, songwriters, and worship leaders. In the intimate setting of the breakout classes, you will be able to get a more personal connection to grow in your area of interest.
