          Encounter God's Presence in a very real way

        %p
          Each day at WorshipU begins with an extended time of worship. Led by Bethel Music artists and guest worship leaders, these are beautiful times of chasing after God and giving Him our honest praise. Alongside fellow students, experience an atmosphere of faith, joy, and hunger as we raise a sound of worship to God together. Come with expectancy about what can happen in God's presence- chains broken, joy unleashed, and revelations revealed.
