You'll hear a raw and vulnerable selection of teachings on matters of the heart, the Spirit of God and the power of worship. With an emphasis on your own personal journey with The Lord, you'll be able to easily apply the lessons to your everyday pursuit of God. Come and join us as we seek the Presence of God together.
