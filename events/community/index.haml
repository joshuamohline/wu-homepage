          This year, WorshipU is taking community to another level! Plenty of time to connect with peers and WorshipU staff is built into your experience. For the duration of WorshipU in Redding, you will be connected with a small group of other worshipers to pray together, write together, and build friendships. During band sessions, you can play alongside your classmates to experience a deeper sense of team. 

        %p
          You are also invited to join our monthly Bethel Worship community meeting. This will be a unique opportunity for WorshipU students to sit in and see how Bethel church facilitates their worship department and all the relationships apart of it. It will be a special time to connect with our team.
