        <p>
          This year, WorshipU is taking community to another level! You will have plenty of intentional times to connect with peers and WorshipU staff. Throughout the 2 weeks in Redding, you will be connected with a small group of other worshippers with whom you can pray together, write together, and build friendships. During band sessions you can play alongside your classmates to experience a true team feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also invite you to join in to the monthly Bethel Worship team community night. This will be a unique opportunity for WorshipU students to sit in and see how Bethel church facilitates an actual worship team meeting. It's a special time to connect with our team.
