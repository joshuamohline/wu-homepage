Music, songwriting, praise and worship have become my passion more and more every day. I'm developing in my ability with an understanding of why I’m doing what I’m doing.  Taking this term opened my eyes to things I’ve never seen or heard before and I’m craving more and more!</div>

I know what I’m called to and feel better equipped. After listening to all the teachings I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me. Although this is a worship school, I’ve never received anything more influential in my life.  I feel like I’ve been saved all over again. God bless the WorshipU program, I highly recommend it!</div>
