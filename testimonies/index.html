I know what I’m called to and feel better equipped. After listening to all the teachings I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me. Although this is a worship school, I’ve never received anything more influential in my life.  I feel like I’ve been saved all over again. God bless the WorshipU program, I highly recommend it!</div>
