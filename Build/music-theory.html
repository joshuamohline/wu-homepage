				<p>Worship leaders, musicians, and writers often have unique strengths and skills specific to their instruments; however, they must all speak one common language, music theory. Theory is the practicum that brings sheet music to life, unites the various instrumental voices, and gives notes and chords meaning. 

                <br><br>This online music theory class from WorshipU is taught by experienced musicians, John Paul Gentile and Jeffrey Kunde. JP has been in the production of Bethel Music projects such as “Loft Sessions”, “Without Words” and “For The Sake of the World”. His understanding of how to apply music theory is clearly articulated and easy to learn. Meanwhile, Jeffrey brings a wealth of knowledge from his years traveling with Jesus Culture and Brian and Jenn Johnson. Along with his studio work, he authored the book ‘Music Theory: The Nashville Number System’. 

                <br><br>This is not a typical theory online course that might be offered at a traditional music school. This course takes the online learning to a much more practical level. Using the piano as his primary instrument for teaching, Jeffrey starts these lessons by teaching on the basic music notes. This includes how to build scales and chords. Once you understand that, he goes into the process of how to number these notes so that you can quickly communicate with your band during a performance. 

                <br><br>Furthermore, he helps you learn how to read typical sheet music and music chords for worship. Often these slash chords and seventh chords confuse young musicians. After these online music classes though, you will be able to read these music sheets with confidence. 
                <br><br>After that, JP breaks down the wide world of music theory to just the essentials needed to be successful in modern worship and band settings. It is recommended that students have a solid grasp of the Nashville number system, scales and chords taught earlier in this course. 

                <br><br>JP discusses more about how to apply your basic knowledge to the format you play in. Teachings include when to play seventh chords, finding inversions, band dynamics, pentatonic scales, and playing within your ability. 

                <br><br>Released over the course of 10 weeks, you will have plenty of time to apply your learning to your everyday playing of music. It will be a great class for knowledgeable students looking to play more professionally and young theorists learning the basics of theory. Lessons can be watched whenever you want, as many times as you want, upon release. </p>
