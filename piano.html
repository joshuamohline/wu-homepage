				<p>Learning how to play the piano is a combination of knowledge, practice, and a good ear. An understanding of the keyboard includes knowing the notes on the piano, knowing how to read piano sheet music and having a basic grasp on music theory. Practicing the piano demands that you know good drills and proper technique. Having a good ear for music is how you will be able to apply your piano playing in worship bands. 
                <br><br>This Basic Piano course from WorshipU hits on all three of these topics. Taught by Bethel Music keyboardist, Kallan Sadler, you will be able to go from a beginner to a valuable asset to your worship team in just a few short online piano lessons. 
                <br><br>Kallan begins this course by teaching the fundamentals of the keyboard. Starting at square one, he makes sure that you know all the note names and how the piano is laid out. All this is important to know before you start playing the piano. 
                <br><br>As the music lessons progress, you will learn more difficult skills like building chords. He teaches chords in such a way, that even if you are asked to play a chord you have never played before, you will be able to figure it out on your own. Building chords and playing scales are the building blocks to anything you will play musically in the future and Kallan insists that you know these. 
                <br><br>Furthermore, he provides a number of great practice exercises that will help you build dexterity in your fingers. By the end of the course, you will be able to read piano chord sheets, play through most any worship song and understand how to play piano tastefully with your worship team.     
                <br><br>All of the classes are pre-recorded for you to watch whenever you want as many times as you want. The next lesson is released at the beginning of each new week. Join Kallan as you embark on your journey of how to play a piano. </p>
