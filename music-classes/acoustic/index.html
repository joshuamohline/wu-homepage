				<p>Acoustic guitar is one of the most basic instruments to learn, but one of the most difficult to master. Playing acoustic is about so much more than just good chords and proper technique. It requires natural feel and an ear for tone. These are skills that are much more difficult to learn without natural musical inclinations. 
                <br><br>In this Acoustic Guitar class from WorshipU, Brian Johnson, Bethel Music Worship leader and songwriter, and John-Paul Gentile, Bethel Music musician, dive into these skills and teach how to grow. They share, in these guitar lessons, what gear, guitars, and techniques they have used to become excellent acoustic guitarists. Watch song tutorials and learn tips and tricks for playing guitar to advance to a new level of playing.  
                <br><br>Some lessons by Brian and JP unpack guitar chord structures. Every major, minor, diminished, suspended or otherwise augmented chord can be played at numerous places on the neck with lots of different finger positions. They show you a few tricks you can learn to easily explore a whole new realm of guitar chords. 
                <br><br>Furthermore, an excellent acoustic player not only learns the varieties of chords, but understands how in every song, chord voicings must be utilized differently. JP explains different formations to change the feel, mood, and tonality of a song. This course includes inversions, alternate tunings, and finger picking versus rhythm acoustic. 
                <br><br>This elective also emphasizes that playing the right chord at the right time can only sound so good without a strong guitar tone. Having the right pre-amps, pedals, guitar strings, and pick-ups can drastically affect the impact of an acoustic guitar. Whether you’re playing solo or in a full band, every nuance of the instrument’s tone matters. 
                <br><br>All of these topics and more are discussed in WorshipU’s acoustic guitar course. Jump in and explore how far you can take your skills. The course is broken into parts that will be released sequentially at the beginning of each week. You will have the opportunity to practice your skills between each lesson. As well, you can go back watch each lesson whenever you want, as many times as you want. </p>
