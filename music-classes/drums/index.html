				<p>Every good house must start with a solid foundation before the framework can be built. Likewise, any great composer will tell you that every beautiful song must begin with a solid foundation upon which the melodies float. In classical music and modern music alike, this solid foundation is delivered in the bass/rhythm section. Drums are the foundation of any modern worship band. It is about more than just knowing the instrument, but actually knowing how to play in the context of worship as an invaluable skill. 
                <br><br>John Paul Gentile takes the time in these online drum lessons to help any drummer increase their value to the worship leader and team. This course starts with the basics and has drum lessons posted sequentially. JP covers topics in the drum lessons such as tuning drums and rudiments. These are basic patterns that you can practice to increase your speed, accuracy and all around chops on the drum set. 
                <br><br>Once you have the fundamentals down, he jumps into more complex topics like miking drums and how to play drums with different worship leaders. This includes a discussion on following the Lord and watching your worship leader for where to go in a set or spontaneous moments. 
                <br><br>The online worship drumming class from WorshipU is released in full, with ongoing access to all the lessons, all the time to give you time to practice everything you learn before moving forward. </p>
