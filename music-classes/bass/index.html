				<p>Every good house must start with a solid foundation before the framework can be built. Likewise, any great composer will tell you that every beautiful song must begin with a beautiful foundation upon which the melodies float. In classical music and modern music alike, this solid foundation is delivered in the bass section. Contemporary rock, pop and worship bands bass section is made up of the kick drum and the bass guitar. The bass is the base. 
                <br><br>Dan Mackenzie and Brandon Aaronson share their combined knowledge of bass guitar to help you build a solid foundation for any worship band. They share over 20 years of guitar experience in live worship and studio. Representing Jesus Culture, Bethel Live, and numerous studio projects, they have a passion to see God displayed through powerful worship and cutting edge music. Their aim is to inform, equip and empower bassists everywhere to become the most solid core of whatever band they are a part of. 

                <br><br>As the course progresses from start to finish, you will learn so much more than just how to play the guitar. These online music lessons will teach the application of your skills to the worship setting. This includes topics such as what guitar to use, what pedals to use, bass anatomy and how to create powerful worship moments. 

                <br><br>With Dan playing his Fender Jazz Bass and Brandon using his 5 string, they have valuable input for any skill level of bass player.
