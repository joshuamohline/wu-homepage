				<p>Singing is the thing that God built inside of us to express ourselves musically to him without need for any accompaniment. It gives our music melody and our lyrics content. Although this amazing gift is given to us naturally (to some more than others), it still must be developed and crafted with practice and coaching. 
                <br><br>This Worship Vocals course, taught by Brian Johnson, Graham Moore, and Leah Valenzuela, discusses how to maximize your vocal skills. They share insight gained through years of group singing, worship leading and recording. If you are already a singer and have a good ear for harmony, this would be a great class for you to hone your skills. 
                <br><br>The class begins with some basic lessons on warming up, using good support, and finding your range. The instruction is focused on helping singers have a lasting career of healthy and rich vocals. 
                <br><br>While learning how to sing entails a lot of different aspects of singing, like vocal health and proper technique, it is equally important to know how to utilize your skills for the situation at hand. This course emphasizes how a singer would use different vocal stylings and techniques when singing background vocals versus being the main vocalist. You may be the singer in both situations, but you would sing very differently depending on your role in the moment. 
                <br><br>The background vocals portion of this class teaches tricks such as softening consonants. This is a very simple technique that can take a group vocal from good to amazing. It’s these subtle adjustments that most singers don’t normally think about  that will be brought to the forefront of your mind during this course. 
                <br><br>Whether you’re a worship leader or background vocalist, this course will be valuable for you. The class will be released parts at the beginning of each week throughout the term. This will give you time to practice your skills between lessons. You can always go back to watch the previous lessons as many times as you want, whenever you want. </p>
